# The Gábor Transform

This project was focused on the generation of spectrograms using the Gábor transform. The goal was to use
time-frequency analysis to determined the musical score for __Mary had a little lamb__.

This project was completed in **MATLAB** and used audio recordings not recorded by myself.
