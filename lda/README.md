# Music Classification

The main focus of this project was to use Machine Learning to train a classifier to determine which category a song falls into.
Different classifiers were trained, each with its own purpose:

* Classify a song from one of 3 artists when trained with 3 artists of _different_ genres.
* Classify a song from one of 3 artists when trained with 3 artists of the _same_ genre.
* Determine the _genre_ of a song from a number of artists when trained with several artists from 3 different genres.

This project was completed in **MATLAB**, and the music was collected from my CD collection at home or from Soundcloud.

Music included songs from Aerosmith, Miles Davis, and The Bee Gees to name a few.
