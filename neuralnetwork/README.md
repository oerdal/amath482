# Neural Networks

The focus of this project was to train two different Machine Learning models, implemented as Neural Networks.
A Fully Connected Neural Network as well as a modification to the famous _LeNet-5_ Convolutional Neural Network was used.

This project was completed in **python** using **Keras** and **tensorflow** with the **Fashion MNIST** data set.
