# Principal Component Analysis

The focus of this project was using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to determine information about a physical scenario.
In particular, the trajectory of a moving object in a spring-mass system was analyzed from different angles and compared
with known laws of physics.

This project was completed in **MATLAB** and the videos containing the objects were not recorded by myself.
